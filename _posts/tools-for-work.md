As a front-end developer, having the right set of tools can significantly enhance your productivity and creativity. In
this article, we‚Äôll explore a curated list of tools that cover various aspects of design, development, note-taking, and
more.

## Design

### Figma

![Figma.com in ‚Äúdeveloper mode‚Äù](/images/blog/tools-for-work/figma.png)

Figma is a versatile design tool. Use it for both design and development. It is useful at every stage: brainstorming,
prototyping, and design. I use *FigJam* whiteboard for visualizing complex schemes, architectures, user-flow charts, and
UML diagrams. Also, Figma has a *development mode* where you can easily copy CSS code or use one of the plugins to get
the code you need, for example, components with Tailwind classes. Strongly recommend taking a look at the variety of
plugins that will dramatically decrease your time coding styles so you can focus on more exiting things.

### Coolors

Free color pallets generator. Very simple and useful in the earliest stages of the design. You can save the colors you
like and try to combine them with others. If not sure ‚Äî you can get inspiration from a wide library of existing pallets.

### Material design Type scale generator

![Material design Type scale generator](/images/blog/tools-for-work/type-system.png)

If you want to have consistent font styling throughout an app ‚Äî use this design system. The use is pretty simple: Select
Headers and Body fonts and it will adjust font parameters for these fonts. It will include font size, weight, and letter
spacing ensuring that your font always will be consistent and readable. You can learn more about the type system here:

## Content creation

One of the best tools for generating images does a great job of giving design and style inspirations and illustrations.
Use it when you want to showcase your front-end skills with the implementation of visually appealing designs without
spending hours designing from scratch or money on professional designers.

### Grammarly

Developer‚Äôs job is not only writing code but also writing emails, documentation, and more. If you are unsure about
grammar or you writing not in your native language (like me) ‚Äî might give your writing a quick check. Grammarly will not
just highlight errors but will give you options on how to fix them. With a Premium subscription, it even helps you
rewrite whole sentences, to adjust the tone for example.

And if you struggling with being eloquent ‚Äî good old chat GPT will help you to find all the words you need and make you
sound *perspicacious and sesquipedalian, embellishing your prose with an array of recherch√© vocabulary and esoteric
phrasings*.

### Chrome Capture

![Chrome Capture](/images/blog/tools-for-work/chrome-capture.jpg)

Simple Chrome extension to record short GIFs or videos in the browser. The main benefit is how it is quick and simple, I
used it for all screen recordings that you might see here and in my previous articles. Your documentation will glow up
once you start adding GIFs as showcases. Sometimes it‚Äôs easily to show than to explain :)

### Obsidian

for styling, Has a lot of color themes and you can add links between the files to navigate through interactive filemap.

## Development

One of the significant features of GitHub for a front-end developer is GitHub Pages. You can host any static page online
for free. I use it mostly for hosting personal non-commercial projects to show as a portfolio.

### PageSpeed Insights

If you like the idea ‚Äî you can also try GitHub Copilot, but it will cost you $10/month after a free trial.

It has so many tools, that I will need to write a whole separate article covering all of them. Instead, this time I will
only show screenshots and share my most used of them :)

#### Color Picker

and get desired color code in a convenient format (HEX, RGB, HSL)

#### Screen Ruler
